# Requirements
## Introduction
We all the experienced internet banking and how accounts are created and maintained in finger tips.
As a project this tries to replicate the complete functioning of a real project. 


In this bank management system project in C, file handling has been used for almost all functions. File has been used to store data related to new account, transaction, editing of account information and viewing of account information. I haven’t used file handling for the menu, interest calculation and password.
